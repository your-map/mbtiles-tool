## üìñ Examples & Usage

### ‚ÜòÔ∏è Replace

In order to reuse the project for your application, you need to replace the following items

Change the path to the cli to the name of your utility `cmd/cli` -> `cmd/your_name_cli`

In the `.goreleaser.yaml` file, you need to change the name of the `cli` to your utility

```yaml
version: 2

env:
  - GO111MODULE=on

project_name: your_name_cli
```

Change the application name in the `Makefile`

```makefile
build:
	go mod vendor
	go build -ldflags "-w -s" -o your_name_cli cmd/your_name_cli/main.go
```

Change the application description in the root command - `configs/constname/root.go`

### ‚å®Ô∏è Command

Commands are created in the directory - `internal/command`

We are creating a file based on the example of the file - `internal/command/example.go`

After creation, add the command to `internal/command/root.go`

```go
package command

func Run() {
	// Other code
	cmd.AddCommand(
		exampleCmd,
		// Add new comments here
	)
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configs

`configs/constname` - This directory contains files for the names of commands, their descriptions, etc.

You can add or change team data in this space

### üóØÔ∏è Components

The components use [huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh)

<img alt="Running a burger form" width="600" src="https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-3J4i6HE3yBmz6SUO3HqILr.gif">

The components in the application are located here - `internal/component`

These components can be either a form or a separate element of it - further logic depends on your needs

I described the standard example in the file - `internal/component/form`

We divide the logic into the form itself and what it outputs in a separate structure with fields that it returns

The application also uses the `internal/component/output/output.go` component. It is designed to display text in
different colors

### üóíÔ∏è Version

The app receives the version during the build using [Goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/)

The version that you specified in the repository when creating the new release will be installed

### üìù Release

The release is being assembled with the help of [Goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/)

You can see exactly what is going on here - `.goreleaser.yaml`

### ‚úçÔ∏è Lint

the project has golangci-lint which adjusts your code

to launch it, specify - `make lint`

### üëª GitHub Actions

Jobs are configured here to check the quality of the code through lint and also add binary files of your application for
different OS

In order for the job release to work, you need to specify the GH token in the certificates of your project

The secret should be called - `GO_RELEASER`
